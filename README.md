# ESP8266-ESP32-MicroPython
My MicroPython projects for ESP8266 and ESP32 -- Usually adapting 3rd party H/W to work on these two MCUs.

Projects:
    A.) I2C_1602_LCD & I2C_2004_LCD:
       1.) Modified xioziyangs "mp_i2c_lcd1602.py" library to support multiple such devices on a single MCU board
       2.) Developend severa example programs for ESP8266 and ESP32 to demonstrate how drivers should be used.
       3.) Modified my driver mentioned in iten 1 (above) to support 1 or 2 LCD devices be they 16x2 or 20x4.
