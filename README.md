<b>ESP8266-ESP32-MicroPython</b><br>
My MicroPython projects for ESP8266 and ESP32<br>
(usually adapting 3rd party H/W & drivers to work on these two MCUs.

Projects:<br>
A.) I2C_1602_LCD & I2C_2004_LCD:
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Modified Xioziyang's "mp_i2c_lcd1602.py" library to support multiple I2C_1602_LCD devices on a single MCU board</li>
<li>Developed several example programs for ESP8266 and ESP32 to demonstrate how the "i2c_lcd" driver should be used.</li>
<li>Modified my driver mentioned above to support 1 or 2 LCD devices be they 16x2 or 20x4. With an ESP32 can do 4 such displays.</li>
<li>Added support for up to 8 custom characters. Now can do a real degrees symbol & more. </li>
</ol></blockquote><br>
B.) ESP32 Datalogger:
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Version 2</li>
<li>Version 3</li>
</ol></blockquote>
